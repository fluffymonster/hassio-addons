## About

WeeWX is a free, open source, software program, written in Python, which interacts with your weather station to produce graphs, reports, and HTML pages. It can optionally publish to weather sites or web servers. It uses modern software concepts, making it simple, robust, and easy to extend. It includes extensive documentation.
WeeWX runs under most versions of Linux, as well as macOS, *BSD, and Solaris. Many users are running on the Raspberry Pi. The images on this page and throughout this web site are from sample stations running WeeWX.
Thousands of stations throughout the world run WeeWX, many of whom have opted-in to be shown on our station map.
